            Astrology is a predictive science with its own sets of methods,
            claims and findings that have forever inspired and allowed people
            with insights into different aspects of their life. Astrology, with
            its wows and hows, is contentful and approving enough to make people
            a believer of the same. And thankfully, it continues to do so
            despite the world shifting bases from what they believe in and what
            they donâ€™t. <br />
            If one has to go into the technicalities of astrology, it is the
            study of different cosmic objects, which are usually stars and
            planets, that have an effect on the lives of the people. You must be
            aware that there are as many as 8 planets in the solar system.
            However, If I ask an online astrologer near me about the planets in
            astrology, they will tell me that there are as many as 9 planets in
            astrology also called Navagrahas. And surprisingly, the planet
            Earth, in astrology, is not counted among the nine planets.
